# budgetcalculator
Quicken JavaScript budget calculator. This calculator is slightly different than the one [here](http://jeffreysbrother.github.io/calculator/); it uses Babel to compile the assets in `modulesrc` to `moduledist`. For some reason, using arrow functions in the progress.js file breaks functionality ... so the only ES6 features in play are constants (which is pretty boring).
